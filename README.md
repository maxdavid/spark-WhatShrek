# What Shrek?

Files used for the *What Shrek?* Spark AR filter. This filter was meant to parody the common 'What Pokémon Are You?' filters that are extremely common on Instagram, but instead of getting a Pokémon, you get a Shrek!

Filter accessible on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=2732931206802910).

Subfolder `WhatShrek` contains the AR project files.
